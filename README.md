Welcome to the **Water Supply Management System** project! This repository houses the code and documentation for developing an advanced water supply management system aimed at addressing the inefficiencies and challenges in urban water distribution.

## 🚰 Problem Statement

Indore, a city heavily reliant on the Narmada River for its water supply, faces significant challenges in monitoring and managing the distribution of water to households. The lack of a household-level monitoring system leads to:
- Inefficiencies in water usage.
- Inability to detect and address leakages.
- Unequal distribution of water.

## 🎯 Objectives

The project aims to:

1. **Implement Monitoring Systems**: Develop digital and physical systems to measure the water received by each household.
2. **Data Collection and Analysis**: Create a continuous data collection system on water usage per household for detailed analysis.
3. **Reporting and Management**: Generate comprehensive reports on water distribution and usage to identify trends and inefficiencies.
4. **Ensure Equitable Distribution**: Guarantee that water is fairly distributed across all households.
5. **Leakage Detection and Prevention**: Use data to identify and address potential leakages in the distribution network.
